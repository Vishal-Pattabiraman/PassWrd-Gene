I decided to create the Password generator website using the HTML,CSS and JavaScript and I this Website we can create Random Password included the any Symbols,Uppercase Letters,Lowercase Letters and it also including the Numbers..
In this website we can change the length of the password 
Step 1: First we need to select checkboxes which type of characters are we want for the Password 
Step 2: Then we need to "click" the button so it run and generates the Password 
Step 3: If we need the passWord we can copy the password on the clipboard Using the Clipboard Icon
